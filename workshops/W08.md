# Workshop Week 8 - Data Analytics

In this Workshop you will use the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio to undertake some data analytics.

Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio is a cloud service that provides a point-and-click interface for the development of end-to-end machine learning applications. This service requires registration, but for this course you can use the free account. Microsoft also offers an academic account but this account may require you to provide credit card information. For additional information about this service, look at this documentation:

* [What is Azure Machine Learning Studio?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/what-is-ml-studio)
* [Azure for Students FAQ](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/free-account-students-faq/)

As you will see in this week's workshop, this interface is fairly powerful. In addition, there are many examples of machine learning applications in the [Azure AI Gallery](https://gallery.azure.ai/), which you can browse and import into your workspace.

## Create your first data science experiment in Azure Machine Learning studio

Follow the instructions of the introductory online machine learning tutorial and create an experiment that predicts automobile prices.

* [5-minute quickstart: Build a model](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/create-experiment)

In the process, answer the following questions:

1. How do the steps in the tutorial relate to the Steps in a Data Mining Project that we have seen in the lectures?
2. What kind of machine learning did you produce? Supervised or unsupervised? Why?
3. Identify which of the variables were categorical, and which ones were numerical.

As an optional activity, follow these instructions to deploy the model as a web service:

* [Deploy an Azure Machine Learning web service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/publish-a-machine-learning-web-service)

## Create, train and evaluate a predictive analytic model

Follow the instructions of this more detailed series of tutorials. The task is to predict an individual's credit risk based on the information they gave on a credit application.

* [Train and evaluate several models](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/machine-learning/studio/tutorial-part2-credit-risk-train)
* (optional) [Deploy a web service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/machine-learning/studio/tutorial-part3-credit-risk-deploy)
